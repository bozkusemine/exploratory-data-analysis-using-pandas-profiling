# Exploratory Data Analysis Using Pandas Profiling

Python · Diabetes Dataset

**pandas-profiling generates profile reports from a pandas DataFrame. The pandas df.describe() function is handy yet a little basic for exploratory data analysis. pandas-profiling extends pandas DataFrame with df.profile_report(), which automatically generates a standardized univariate and multivariate report for data understanding.**

· For each column, the following information (whenever relevant for the column type) is presented in an interactive HTML report:

*Type inference: detect the types of columns in a DataFrame*

*Essentials: type, unique values, indication of missing values*

*Quantile statistics: minimum value, Q1, median, Q3, maximum, range, interquartile range*

*Descriptive statistics: mean, mode, standard deviation, sum, median absolute deviation, coefficient of variation, kurtosis, skewness*

*Most frequent and extreme values*

*Histograms: categorical and numerical*

*Correlations: high correlation warnings, based on different correlation metrics (Spearman, Pearson, Kendall, Cramér’s V, Phik)*

*Missing values: through counts, matrix and heatmap*

*Duplicate rows: list of the most common duplicated rows*

*Text analysis: most common categories (uppercase, lowercase, separator), scripts (Latin, Cyrillic) and blocks (ASCII, Cyrilic)*

*File and Image analysis: file sizes, creation dates, dimensions, indication of truncated images and existence of EXIF metadata.*
